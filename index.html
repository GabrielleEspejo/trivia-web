      <h4>Definition of trivia</h4>
      <strong>triv¬∑ia | tr…™vi…ô</strong>
      <p>
        When you hear the word Trivia, you might think of answering questions on
        pop culture and geography with your friends around a pub table, or going
        around a board collecting six colored wedges in a pie. This common sense
        of the word refers not just to knowledge, but a particular kind of
        knowledge: obscure facts and details that aren't applicable to one's
        day-to-day life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legend has it that travelers would meet at the intersection of three
        crossroads to exchange news, gossip, and tiny interesting facts. Some
        think the word trivia derives from this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trivia was introduced in <strong>the early 20th century</strong> as the
        noun form of the word <q>trivial</q> which comes from the Latin
        <q>trivialis.</q> Trivialis means that which is in, or belongs to, the
        crossroads or public streets; hence, that may be found everywhere,
        common. It is derived from <q>trivium</q> which means a place where
        three roads meet.

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Modern Use,</strong>
        Bits of information of little consequence was the title of a popular
        book by British aphorist Logan Pearsall Smith (1865-1946), first
        published in 1902 but popularized in 1918. It consisted of short essays
        often tied to observation of small things and commonplace moments. In
        the 1918 version of his book Trivia, Smith wrote:
        <br />
        <br />
        <q
          >I KNOW too much; I have stuffed too many of the facts of History and
          Science into my intellectuals. My eyes have grown dim over books;
          believing in geological periods, cave dwellers, Chinese Dynasties, and
          the fixed stars has prematurely aged me.</q

          Whether or not you got the answer to that question, you might be
          wondering what its purpose was in the first place.
          <q>That‚Äôs such a trivial thing to ask!</q> you may say. While such a
          declaration wouldn‚Äôt be completely amiss, it would overlook some
          underlying crucial points. Yes, trivia questions asking for things
          such as the capital city of a Balkan state may seem pointless but, if
          you are willing to dig deeper, you might find that there is more to
          trivia than meets the eye.<br /><br />
          One of trivia‚Äôs primary benefits is that it enables you to learn a
          surprising amount about a wide variety of subjects. What makes trivia
          so challenging <em>(and fun)</em> is that the questions can come from
          virtually any area of knowledge known to man. One minute, you may be
          trying to come up with the name of the peace settlement that ended the
          Mexican-American War <em>(the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo)</em>, and
          the next, you may be racking your brain in an effort to name the
          greatest album of all time topped by
          <span>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Gaye" target="_blank"
              >Marvin Gaye's</a
            > </span
          ><em>What's Going On (1971)</em>
        </p>

      <div class="boxOne">
        <p>Did you know that Barbra Streisand has cloned her dog twice? ü§Ø</p>

          />
          <p>
          Finally, it must be said that trivia should never be equated with
          intelligence. Knowing that
          <span>
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer"
              target="_blank"
              >Johannes Vermeer</a
            >
          </span>
          painted <em><q>Meisje met de parel</q></em> doesn't necessarily mean
          that one is smarter than everyone else; it just means that one knows
          that <strong>Johannes Vermeer </strong>painted
          <em><q>Meisje met de parel</q></em
          >. Thus, you shouldn‚Äôt feel stupid if you fail to know the response to
          trivia questions; rather, you should take note of the correct answers
          and try to remember them the next time they are mentioned.

            File that little tidbit away in your brain, you never know when you
            might need it.
